Research diary for hypotheses, architectural reasoning, and reflective experiment logs.

---

## Overview

---

## Research Context

Thinking artifacts support epistemic transparency: what was assumed, tested, revised, and retained.

---

## Installation / Usage

No runtime setup required. Add timestamped notes and hypothesis files as research evolves.

---
